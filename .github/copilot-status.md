## Previous Completed Task

*   **Date:** 2025-04-23 14:30
*   **Task:** Implemented basic project structure, NextAuth setup with Google Provider and Credentials Provider.
*   **Files Modified:**
    *   `src/lib/auth.ts`

## Current Task / In Progress

*   **Task:** Testing and fixing Redux hooks integration in components.
*   **Files Being Modified:**
    *   Components using Redux (checking for proper hook usage)
*   **Status:** Verifying Redux hooks implementation in components and fixing any components using direct useDispatch/useSelector.
*   **Blockers/Issues:** Need to verify MCP server integration - Context7 MCP, Prisma MCP, and Shadcn UI MCP server integration status unclear.

## Next Planned Tasks

1.  Set up Redux Toolkit store and feature slices for key functionality (site audits, keywords, backlinks).
2.  Implement the site audit feature using Crawlee.js with proper database storage via Prisma MCP.
3.  Create dashboard components for displaying SEO data using Shadcn UI MCP.
4.  Set up Gemini 1.5 Flash API integration for AI-driven SEO insights.

## General Notes & Reminders

*   Remember to use `useAppSelector` and `useAppDispatch` typed hooks in all components.
*   Always use Prisma MCP server for database operations.
*   Always use Shadcn UI MCP server for UI component generation.
*   Use Context7 MCP for project-wide context and knowledge integration.
*   Focus on implementing the site audit feature next, as it's a core feature.
*   Ensure all API endpoints include proper authentication validation via NextAuth.
*   Use `.env.local` for all environment variables and API keys.
