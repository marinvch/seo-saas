### 1.4 GitHub Copilot Usage Guidelines & Prompts

**Core Principles:**

- **Adhere Strictly to Instructions:** Follow all guidelines in this document precisely.
- **Prioritize MCP Servers:** Leverage Context7, Prisma, and Shadcn UI MCP servers for optimized, modular, and context-aware code generation.
- **Maintain Consistency:** Ensure generated code aligns with existing project structure, naming conventions, and coding style (use Prettier/ESLint if configured).
- **Focus on Readability & Maintainability:** Generate clear, well-commented code. Apply DRY principles.
- **Verify & Fix:** After generating code, always check the terminal and VS Code 'Problems' tab for errors. Read and fix them immediately. Ensure the application runs correctly.
- **Remove Duplication:** Actively identify and refactor duplicated code blocks or logic.
- **Context Management (CRITICAL):**
  - **Before starting work** in any new chat session or on a new task, **READ** the `d:\Projects\Personal\seo-saas\.github\copilot-status.md` file thoroughly to understand the last completed task, current progress, and next steps.
  - **After completing a significant task** or **before ending a chat session**, **UPDATE** the `d:\Projects\Personal\seo-saas\.github\copilot-status.md` file with the details of the completed work, the status of any ongoing work, and any relevant notes or blockers.
